### REGISTER NUMBER :212221040022 
### AIM: 
To write a program to train the classifier for basic email spam detection.
###  Algorithm:
Create a function detectSpam that takes the email content as an argument and checks for the presence of specific spam keywords.
Define an array of common spam words.
Iterate through the array to check if any of the spam words are present in the email content.
If any of the spam words are found, return 1 (spam detected); otherwise, return 0 (not spam).
In the main function, prompt the user to input the email content.
Call the detectSpam function with the input email content and output whether the email is classified as spam or not.

### Program:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Function to detect spam emails
int detectSpam(char email[]) {
    // Simple spam keyword detection
    char *spamWords[] = {"buy", "discount", "offer", "free", "limited", "money"};

    // Check if the email contains any spam keywords
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        if (strstr(email, spamWords[i]) != NULL) {
            return 1; // Spam detected
        }
    }

    return 0; // Not spam
}

int main() {
    // Input email content
    char emailContent[1000];
    printf("Enter the email content: ");
    fgets(emailContent, 1000, stdin);

    // Detect spam
    if (detectSpam(emailContent) == 1) {
        printf("The email is classified as spam.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The email is not spam.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}



### Output:




### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
